    "There are 6 access modes in python.\n",
    "1.Read Only (‘r’) : Open text file for reading. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exists, raises the I/O error. This is also the default mode in which a file is opened.\n",
    "2.Read and Write (‘r+’): Open the file for reading and writing. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file. Raises I/O error if the file does not exist.\n",
    "3.Write Only (‘w’) : Open the file for writing. For the existing files, the data is truncated and over-written. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file. Creates the file if the file does not exist.\n",

    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. When we use the close() file Python method over a file object then it flushes any unwritten information and eventually closes the file object. \n",
    "     This makes sure that no more writing can be done in that file.\n",
    "     The close() method closes an open file. You should always close your files, in some cases, due to buffering, changes made to a file may not show until you close the file.\n",
    "    It is important because files are limited resources managed by the operating system, making sure files are closed after use will protect against hard-to-debug issues like running out of file handles or experiencing corrupted data."
